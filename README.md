Project Name: RoutingSPA: this exercise, highlights the use of simple Bootstrap web components, creating custom web components, and then convert them to React components. Futhermore, we fopcused on how to create a single-page application (SPA) and learn when to use a SPA versus a multi-page application. Finally, we bought it all together by completing an exercise where youâ€™ll create the routing on a page with a Bootstrap navigation bar.

How to Install and Run the Project.

Download - Project files to local machine Click and drag HTML file to local web browser. Once projected on the browser you will see the nav bar with three links. In the background, on the router.js page you will see the code that created the router- linking all the pages together. 

Roadmap of future improvements: This was a training exercise. however, I will be applying these techniques to future projects. 

Enhancments: I did include the MIT logo above the Nav bar. once you click the logo it will lead you to the MIT website.
